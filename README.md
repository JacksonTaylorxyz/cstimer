# Jackson's self hosted csTimer

This is my fork to be able to self host it on my own website. The original can be found [here](https://github.com/cs0x7f/cstimer)

I don't use most of the features of the original timer, such as WCA login or any of the giker/bluetooth cube stuff. I will most likely remove a lot of this code in coming commits.
